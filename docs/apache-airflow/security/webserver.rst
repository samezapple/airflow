Webserver
=========

This topic describes how to configure Airflow to secure your webserver.

Rendering Airflow UI in a Web Frame from another site
------------------------------------------------------

Using Airflow in a web frame is enabled by default. To disable this (and prevent click jacking attacks)
set the below:

.. code-block:: ini

    [webserver]
    x_frame_enabled = False

Disable Deployment Exposure Warning
---------------------------------------

Airflow warns when recent requests are made to ``/robots.txt``. To disable this warning set ``warn_deployment_exposure`` to
``False`` as below:

.. code-block:: ini

    [webserver]
    warn_deployment_exposure = False

Sensitive Variable fields
-------------------------

Variable values that are deemed "sensitive" based on the variable name will be masked in the UI automatically.
See :ref:`security:mask-sensitive-values` for more details.

.. _web-authentication:

Web Authentication
------------------

By default, Airflow requires users to specify a password prior to login. You can use the
following CLI commands to create an account:

.. code-block:: bash

    # create an admin user
    airflow users create \
        --username admin \
        --firstname Peter \
        --lastname Parker \
        --role Admin \
        --email spiderman@superhero.org

To deactivate the authentication and allow users to be identified as Anonymous, the following entry
in ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/webserver_config.py`` needs to be set with the desired role that the Anonymous
user will have by default:

.. code-block:: ini

    AUTH_ROLE_PUBLIC = 'Admin'

Be sure to checkout :doc:`/security/api` for securing the API.

.. note::

   Airflow uses the config parser of Python. This config parser interpolates
   '%'-signs.  Make sure escape any ``%`` signs in your config file (but not
   environment variables) as ``%%``, otherwise Airflow might leak these
   passwords on a config parser exception to a log.

Password
''''''''

One of the simplest mechanisms for authentication is requiring users to specify a password before logging in.

Please use command line interface ``airflow users create`` to create accounts, or do that in the UI.

Other Methods
'''''''''''''

Since Airflow 2.0, the default UI is the Flask App Builder RBAC. A ``webserver_config.py`` configuration file
is automatically generated and can be used to configure the Airflow to support authentication
methods like OAuth, OpenID, LDAP, REMOTE_USER. It should be noted that due to the limitation of Flask AppBuilder
and Authlib, only a selection of OAuth2 providers is supported. This list includes ``github``, ``githublocal``, ``twitter``,
``linkedin``, ``google``, ``azure``, ``openshift``, ``okta``, ``keycloak`` and ``keycloak_before_17``.

The default authentication option described in the :ref:`Web Authentication <web-authentication>` section is related
with the following entry in the ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/webserver_config.py``.

.. code-block:: ini

    AUTH_TYPE = AUTH_DB

A WSGI middleware could be used to manage very specific forms of authentication
(e.g. `SPNEGO <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/core?topic=authentication-single-sign-http-requests-using-spnego-web>`_)
and leverage the REMOTE_USER method:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Any, Callable

    from flask import current_app
    from flask_appbuilder.const import AUTH_REMOTE_USER


    class CustomMiddleware:
        def __init__(self, wsgi_app: Callable) -> None:
            self.wsgi_app = wsgi_app

        def __call__(self, environ: dict, start_response: Callable) -> Any:
            # Custom authenticating logic here
            # ...
            environ["REMOTE_USER"] = "username"
            return self.wsgi_app(environ, start_response)


    current_app.wsgi_app = CustomMiddleware(current_app.wsgi_app)

    AUTH_TYPE = AUTH_REMOTE_USER

Another way to create users is in the UI login page, allowing user self registration through a "Register" button.
The following entries in the ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/webserver_config.py`` can be edited to make it possible:

.. code-block:: ini

    AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION = True
    AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION_ROLE = "Desired Role For The Self Registered User"
    RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = 'private_key'
    RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = 'public_key'

    MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    MAIL_USE_TLS = True
    MAIL_USERNAME = 'yourappemail@gmail.com'
    MAIL_PASSWORD = 'passwordformail'
    MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'sender@gmail.com'

The package ``Flask-Mail`` needs to be installed through pip to allow user self registration since it is a
feature provided by the framework Flask-AppBuilder.

To support authentication through a third-party provider, the ``AUTH_TYPE`` entry needs to be updated with the
desired option like OAuth, OpenID, LDAP, and the lines with references for the chosen option need to have
the comments removed and configured in the ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/webserver_config.py``.

For more details, please refer to
`Security section of FAB documentation <https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html>`_.

Example using team based Authorization with GitHub OAuth
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
There are a few steps required in order to use team-based authorization with GitHub OAuth.

* configure OAuth through the FAB config in webserver_config.py
* create a custom security manager class and supply it to FAB in webserver_config.py
* map the roles returned by your security manager class to roles that FAB understands.

Here is an example of what you might have in your webserver_config.py:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.auth.managers.fab.security_manager.override import FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride
    from flask_appbuilder.security.manager import AUTH_OAUTH
    import os

    AUTH_TYPE = AUTH_OAUTH
    AUTH_ROLES_SYNC_AT_LOGIN = True  # Checks roles on every login
    AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION = True  # allow users who are not already in the FAB DB to register

    AUTH_ROLES_MAPPING = {
        "Viewer": ["Viewer"],
        "Admin": ["Admin"],
    }
    # If you wish, you can add multiple OAuth providers.
    OAUTH_PROVIDERS = [
        {
            "name": "github",
            "icon": "fa-github",
            "token_key": "access_token",
            "remote_app": {
                "client_id": os.getenv("OAUTH_APP_ID"),
                "client_secret": os.getenv("OAUTH_APP_SECRET"),
                "api_base_url": "https://api.github.com",
                "client_kwargs": {"scope": "read:user, read:org"},
                "access_token_url": "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",
                "authorize_url": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",
                "request_token_url": None,
            },
        },
    ]


    class CustomSecurityManager(FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride):
        pass


    # Make sure to replace this with your own implementation of AirflowSecurityManager class
    SECURITY_MANAGER_CLASS = CustomSecurityManager

Here is an example of defining a custom security manager.
This class must be available in Python's path, and could be defined in
webserver_config.py itself if you wish.

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.auth.managers.fab.security_manager.override import FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride
    import logging
    from typing import Any, List, Union
    import os

    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    log.setLevel(os.getenv("AIRFLOW__LOGGING__FAB_LOGGING_LEVEL", "INFO"))

    FAB_ADMIN_ROLE = "Admin"
    FAB_VIEWER_ROLE = "Viewer"
    FAB_PUBLIC_ROLE = "Public"  # The "Public" role is given no permissions
    TEAM_ID_A_FROM_GITHUB = 123  # Replace these with real team IDs for your org
    TEAM_ID_B_FROM_GITHUB = 456  # Replace these with real team IDs for your org


    def team_parser(team_payload: dict[str, Any]) -> list[int]:
        # Parse the team payload from GitHub however you want here.
        return [team["id"] for team in team_payload]


    def map_roles(team_list: list[int]) -> list[str]:
        # Associate the team IDs with Roles here.
        # The expected output is a list of roles that FAB will use to Authorize the user.

        team_role_map = {
            TEAM_ID_A_FROM_GITHUB: FAB_ADMIN_ROLE,
            TEAM_ID_B_FROM_GITHUB: FAB_VIEWER_ROLE,
        }
        return list(set(team_role_map.get(team, FAB_PUBLIC_ROLE) for team in team_list))


    class GithubTeamAuthorizer(FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride):
        # In this example, the oauth provider == 'github'.
        # If you ever want to support other providers, see how it is done here:
        # https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/master/flask_appbuilder/security/manager.py#L550
        def get_oauth_user_info(self, provider: str, resp: Any) -> dict[str, Union[str, list[str]]]:
            # Creates the user info payload from Github.
            # The user previously allowed your app to act on their behalf,
            #   so now we can query the user and teams endpoints for their data.
            # Username and team membership are added to the payload and returned to FAB.

            remote_app = self.appbuilder.sm.oauth_remotes[provider]
            me = remote_app.get("user")
            user_data = me.json()
            team_data = remote_app.get("user/teams")
            teams = team_parser(team_data.json())
            roles = map_roles(teams)
            log.debug(f"User info from Github: {user_data}\nTeam info from Github: {teams}")
            return {"username": "github_" + user_data.get("login"), "role_keys": roles}


SSL
---

SSL can be enabled by providing a certificate and key. Once enabled, be sure to use
"https://" in your browser.

.. code-block:: ini

    [webserver]
    web_server_ssl_cert = <path to cert>
    web_server_ssl_key = <path to key>

Enabling SSL will not automatically change the web server port. If you want to use the
standard port 443, you'll need to configure that too. Be aware that super user privileges
(or cap_net_bind_service on Linux) are required to listen on port 443.

.. code-block:: ini

    # Optionally, set the server to listen on the standard SSL port.
    web_server_port = 443
    base_url = http://<hostname or IP>:443

Enable CeleryExecutor with SSL. Ensure you properly generate client and server
certs and keys.

.. code-block:: ini

    [celery]
    ssl_active = True
    ssl_key = <path to key>
    ssl_cert = <path to cert>
    ssl_cacert = <path to cacert>

Rate limiting
-------------

Airflow can be configured to limit the number of authentication requests in a given time window. We are using
`Flask-Limiter <https://flask-limiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to achieve that and by default Airflow
uses per-webserver default limit of 5 requests per 40 second fixed window. By default no common storage for
rate limits is used between the gunicorn processes you run so rate-limit is applied separately for each process,
so assuming random distribution of the requests by gunicorn with single webserver instance and default 4
gunicorn workers, the effective rate limit is 5 x 4 = 20 requests per 40 second window (more or less).
However you can configure the rate limit to be shared between the processes by using rate limit storage via
setting the ``RATELIMIT_*`` configuration settings in ``webserver_config.py``.
For example, to use Redis as a rate limit storage you can use the following configuration (you need
to set ``redis_host`` to your Redis instance)

.. code-block:: python

    RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URI = "redis://redis_host:6379/0"

You can also configure other rate limit settings in ``webserver_config.py`` - for more details, see the
`Flask Limiter rate limit configuration <https://flask-limiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html>`_.
